## Local bot

pls you need to create a [Discord](https://discord.com/) account first
Then you can go to the [Discord Developer](https://discord.com/developers/applications) platform
to create your aplication, then your bot, & finally invite it to your server with the OAuth2 url.

Of course we need [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org) to run this bot in our machine.
